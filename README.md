# Palico-Panic
C# project from Spring 2015 semester.
A trivia game based on the Monster Hunter franchise from Capcom. The player must match a rare item with a monster while her companion (Palico) tries to catch a fish. Each bad guess puts the Palico in danger as a hungry monster approaches. The games ends when either the Palico successfully catches his fish or gets eaten. Includes a cheat toggle for people who don't hunt monsters. Developed entirely in Visual Studio.
